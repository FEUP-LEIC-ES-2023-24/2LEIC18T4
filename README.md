## Main Theme

The Goal that was proposed to us for this project was creating an app that aligns with the sustainable development goals [(SDGs)](https://www.eca.europa.eu/en/sustainable-development-goals) is a meaningful and impactful way to contribute to global challenges, in a FEUP-centric setting, that may be expanded to other faculties, possibly universities.
As such, we have arrived as themes such as:
- Study Spots which can be selected for their sustainability, energy efficiency, waste reduction and have interactive maps with user ratings and calendar events, for example
- ...
- ...
