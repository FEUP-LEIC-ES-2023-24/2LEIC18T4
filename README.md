## Main Theme

The Goal that was proposed to us for this project was creating an app that aligns with the sustainable development goals [(SDGs)](https://www.eca.europa.eu/en/sustainable-development-goals) is a meaningful and impactful way to contribute to global challenges, in a FEUP-centric setting, that may be expanded to other faculties, possibly universities.
As such, we have arrived at a central theme:
- Finding Study Spots, which can be selected for their sustainability, energy efficiency, waste reduction and have interactive maps with user ratings and calendar events, for example.

## Product Vision

### Vision:
#### What is the purpose for creating the product?
As students, finding places to study is a harder task than most would imagine. The obvious choice for most of us would be our library, but it’s full most of the time. This product aims to help students find alternatives. It also allows for various places and establishments to advertise their locations to students.
#### Which positive change should it bring about?
It expands student’s choices and, as our product favours green and sustainable places, it also makes them more environmentally conscientious.
### Target Group:
#### Which market or market segment does the product address?
It addresses the university student market and establishment's owners.

#### Who are the target customers and users?
Students
Universities
Coffee Shops
City Hall
Libraries
Shopping Malls

### Needs:
#### What problem does the product solve?
It solves the problem of students having nowhere to go to study in-group or alone and/or without conditions, establishments owners not being able to get a strong, desired and consistent customer base, and facilitating not only the city hall, but also libraries, universities, etc, to better accommodate and help its student population.
#### Which benefit does it provide?
It solves the problem of students having nowhere to go to study in-group or alone and/or without conditions, by proposing several study spots within an area chosen by the user, having in mind its current location. The app not only shows those spots but also informs the student of the sustainability of the spots available and other amenities they might require (electricity, internet, space,...).
Having this in mind, the benefit of the app it's to make not only the students' lives easier but also to advertise those study spots (benefiting them by their sustainability ranking).
### Product:
#### What product is it?
It is an app designed to help students during their school years to find the best places to study and learn, according to their needs.

#### What makes it stand out?
Usability
Variety of options
Student focused
